The New York Public Library's Digital Preservation program began in 2015. Its mission is to ensure the long-term stability and accessibility of the Library's digital collections. Currently this includes 4+ petabytes of data across 30+ million files from digitization and born-digital collection programs.

The program manages the Library's Digital Archives unit and works closely with NYPL's Digital Imaging Unit (DIU) and Presevation of Audio and Moving Images (PAMI) programs.
